Analysis Summary 

The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationship between schools preformance and standerized test scores within a District. After a number of calculations the results show that Charter schools have close to 40% higher overall passing test results than District School. Additionally, smaller schools in terms of student population apear to preform better on standerdized tests than largers schools. This can mean there is more attention and, or more resources are available for students in smaller schools. Additional data we could pull that would be benificial would be the number of teachers per school.
